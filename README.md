## Credits and Attributions

This extension is a fork of the original began at https://github.com/rsmiller213/VSC-Language-EssCalc which hasn't been updated in some time. I have been struggling to find a language extension for Essbase Calculation Language that functioned as well as some other languages and other programs. I prefer VS Code over other editors and decided that I would try and make my own language extension. It is by no means perfect, nor is it functionally complete. There are several items on the to do list.

In working on getting it to work correctly I leveraged several other samples, examples, and code found on various sites. I took some of the framework from this example: https://github.com/madskristensen/TextmateSample
and used it for portions of the layout of language grammars. 

I also consulted this guide: https://gist.github.com/Aerijo/b8c82d647db783187804e86fa0a604a1 for help and more examples. 

Any other code in the files contained within this project is either code that I developed, the original author of the extension developed, or loose code snippets found elsewhere. If it looks like your code and I haven't attributed it correctly, please let me know and I will update the attributions or remove the code if needed.
